# Happy memorizing English words with Nijisanji EN Streams!

Some scripts to help me memorize English words through auditory memory.

## Workflow

1. Get all of the stream VODs

2. Download video captions for each VOD on Youtube

3. Match and filter captions with target word

4. Download video clips by captions timeline

5. Concat clips and export mp4 file

6. Repeat the mp4 file and memorize words with familiar EN vtubers :)

## Tech Stack

- ffmpeg

- PyMongo

- pyttsx3

## TODO

- [ ] Accurate recognition for complete sentences and video clips (Youtube captions are incomplete and unreliable)
